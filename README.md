# GeoLogic Shell
* It is written in Delphi (pascal) and performs  Geomorphometric processing, Region growing segmentation & Terrain pattern recognition
* Used it in papers of mine in between 1999 and 2011 ( http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8395-435X ). 
* There are 2 versions, part of the publications:
* 1. G.Ch. Miliaresis 2001. Extraction of bajadas from digital elevation models and satellite imagery. Computers & Geosciences 27 (10) 1159-1169
* 2. G. Ch. Miliaresis & N. Kokkas, 2007 Segmentation and object-based classification for the extraction of the building class from LIDAR DEMs Computers & Geosciences 33,(8) 1076-1087
* It should be available from the web site of the International Society for Mathematical Geology BUT IS IS NOT ! Look for v27-10-05.zip & v33-08-07.zip to LINKS TO PUBLISHED PROGRAMs CODE (https://www.iamg.org/iamg-publications/computers-geosciences/volumes.html ).  So, I uploaded it in GitHub. Readme.pdf and data (LiDAR DEM) are available for the ver. 2
